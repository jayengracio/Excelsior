To run:
code folder: Runs on java 14 with javaFX 16
jar file: in console in same directory that jar is in run command "java -jar Tintin-Excelsior.jar"

Note: We first implemented the dynamic way of getting all the images in the character images folder, but when switching to make it
runnable from a jar file, our method of dynamically loading the files no longer worked. Since we couldn't find a suitable solution to do this
within the jar format during this sprint, we hardcoded a temporary solution to show the functionality of the character choosing process.
The code used in the jar is visible commented out in the code, so we decided to submit both the jar and the code.

    -Changed colour pallet to allow for dynamic changing of colours. Changes colour when a colour is selected.

Character:
    -changeGender method
        ->Removes female hair, lips and pigtails from the default female image to change to male.
        ->Returns the default image when changing to female
        ->Uses a tolerance when removing hair lips and pigtails to remove anti aliasing
        ->Tolerance includes colours not supposed to be removed. Those colours are exempted in the change method
    -change method
        ->A helper method for changeGender
        ->Checks if the current pixel is a colour that shouldn't be removed by the tolerance
    -change skin colour
