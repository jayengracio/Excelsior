Project built with IntelliJ using Java 14 and JavaFX 16.

HOW TO RUN:
------------------
Using IntelliJ (Or any other IDE):
-> Run the Main class

(May have to import Java FX 16 library in order to work)

Using the jar file:
1. In command line: Change the working directory to where the jar file is located.
2. Type in: java --module-path "PATH_TO_JAVAFX16_LIB" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar Tintin-Excelsior.jar

(Command line's java runtime must be using Java 14)
------------------

Note: We first implemented the dynamic way of getting all the images in the character images folder, but when switching to make it
runnable from a jar file, our method of dynamically loading the files no longer worked. Since we couldn't find a suitable solution to do this
within the jar format during this sprint, we hardcoded a temporary solution to show the functionality of the character choosing process.
The code used in the jar is visible commented out in the code, so we decided to submit both the jar and the code.
