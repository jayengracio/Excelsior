To run:
code folder: Runs on java 14 with javaFX 16
jar file: in console in same directory that jar is in run command "java -jar Tintin-Excelsior.jar"

Note: We first implemented the dynamic way of getting all the images in the character images folder, but when switching to make it
runnable from a jar file, our method of dynamically loading the files no longer worked. Since we couldn't find a suitable solution to do this
within the jar format during this sprint, we hardcoded a temporary solution to show the functionality of the character choosing process.
The code used in the jar is visible commented out in the code, so we decided to submit both the jar and the code.
