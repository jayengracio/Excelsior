## How To Run
Built and Tested using Java 14 and JavaFX 16
Using IntelliJ (Might require VM options):
> Run the Main class

Using the jar file:
> 1. In command line: Change the working directory to where the jar file is located.
> 2. Type in: "java -jar Tintin-Excelsior.jar"

Using Maven: (also builds jar file)
> 1. In terminal: Type command "mvn clean compile assembly:single"
> 2. In terminal: Type command "mvn exec:java"

## Project's Sprints & Workflow

-   **_Overview:_** For all the 9 sprints we had for this project, we met up 3 times a week and talked about how to split the work, who will work on what and checked on each other in the occasional case that a teammate may require help. We had our own Discord server for us to communicate with each other with with proved to be very convenient. Everyone had different amount of experiences with the different technologies that we used in this project like JavaFX and Maven, so being able to have

-   **_Sprints_**: For each sprint, we were tasked with working with a number of User Stories (instructions) in the project's white paper that were provided to us at the start of the module. Our first impressions of the project was that it looked quite intimidating. We were basically asked to build an application from the ground up without any sort of skeletons/templates to work with like previous software engineering projects in the past. But as each week came to pass, working on the project as well as with each other became easier.

-   **_Using Feedback_**: Every week, we were given feedback on how well we did in that week's sprint by the TA. We were given advice on what we could do to improve the code as well as some additional tips we could use for the next sprint. Using this given information, we created some additional work for us to further improve the project outside of what is asked of us in the next sprint as reasonably as we could. These feedback were very useful and assisted us in tackling stuff that we could have overlooked.
