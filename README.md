## Sprints & Workflow

-   **_Working as a Team:_** For all the 9 sprints we had for this project, we met up 3 times a week and talked about how to split the work, who will work on what and checked on each other in the occasional case that a teammate may require help.
    
-   **_Sprints_**. Each sprint we were tasked with working with a number of User Stories that were shown to us in the project's white paper that were provided to us.
